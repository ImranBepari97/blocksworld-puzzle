# blocksworld-puzzle
Blocksworld puzzle and AI for solving puzzle.

This is a Java project which has a self built Blocksworld puzzle in it. The goal for the agent is to stack the lettered blocks 
on top of eachother to solve the puzzle. The HumanInput class let's you play this manually.

The interesting part is where different "AI"s have been included which solve the puzzle for you at varying size.
